Update on DESIGN.pdf:

- add.html will show three random stories/last contributions instead of one. User can choose to have more stories to add to by clicking on the More button below, which will print out three more random stories. If there are no more random stories left for the user to contribute to, nothing will be printed out/happen.
- create.html will have a minimum word requirement.
